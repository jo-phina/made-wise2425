# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Effects of Bilingualism on English Proficiency in the USA

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. Does bilingualism of people who grew up in the USA correlate with English language proficiency as adults? Do different additional languages spoken at home affect English skills in different ways?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
Still today, growing up bilingual is often seen as a problem for developing proper language skills. My theory is that for people who grow up speaking another language is actually advantageous for having advancced language skills later in life. I will try and explore if growing up bilingual (with one language being English) correlates with high English levels. If possible, I will also look at how the correlations change for different languages additional to English.
